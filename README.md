# First-Program
First Python Program I Wrote

This is my first attempt at making a video game. My goal was to figure out how to make an object
move on screen. The code is kind of a mess, but I learned a lot!
The game is called Dot Man. The object of the game is to make it to the goal at the top of
the screen. Have Fun!

Controls :
Left move left
Right move right
Up  jump straight up
L jump left
A jump right
